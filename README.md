The development of the employee management system was drivenby the need to streamline operations. 
Research guided the creationof a user-friendly interface with features like attendance tracking/salary tracking. 
Recognizing the critical role of SQL databases inefficiently managing employee data, I incorporated them into the project to enhance its functionality and usability.The employees table stores employee details like name, withrespective manager, and hire date. Departments organizeemployees based on roles, with the Roles table defining job positions.Attendance and Salaries tables
track employee attendance andcompensation, respectively, aiding in HR management and payrollprocessing.
